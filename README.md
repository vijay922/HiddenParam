# HiddenParam
The code provided is a Go program that reads a list of URLs from a file, sends HTTP GET requests to each URL, parses the HTML content of the responses, appends hidden input field values to the URLs, and writes the modified URLs to an output file.

To use the Go code provided, follow these steps:

- Install Go: Download and install Go from the official website (https://golang.org/) based on your operating system.

- Create a new directory: Create a new directory for your Go project.

- Initialize Go module: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory you created, and run the following command to initialize the Go module:

Copy
go mod init main.go
```

Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the required dependency, goquery:

Copy
go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery
```

- Create a urls.txt file: Create a file named urls.txt in the project directory and populate it with the URLs you want to process, each on a separate line.

- Run the Go code: Save the provided Go code in a file with the ".go" extension, such as main.go. Then, in the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to execute the code:

livecodeserver
Copy
go run main.go
```

- The code will read the URLs from `urls.txt`, process each URL, print the modified URL to the console, and write it to a text file named `output.txt`.

- Check the output: After the code finishes running, you can examine the modified URLs in the console output and find the output.txt file in the project directory, which will contain the modified URLs.
